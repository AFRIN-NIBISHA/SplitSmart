# SplitSmart

## Project Overview
The **SplitSmart** is a web-based tool designed to help users track and fairly divide shared expenses among friends, roommates, or travel companions. Manual expense tracking methods are often error-prone, confusing, and time-consuming. This application simplifies expense management by providing real-time balance calculation, group management, and settlement features.
